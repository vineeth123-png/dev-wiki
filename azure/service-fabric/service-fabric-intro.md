**Important point to note** -   
A Service Fabric cluster is a network-connected set of virtual machines into which your microservices are deployed and managed. Service Fabric clusters can be deployed using any standard size Windows Server or Linux virtual machines. **You are only charged for the compute instances, storage, networking resources, and IP addresses you choose when creating a Service Fabric cluster. There is no charge for the service offered by Service Fabric itself with this deployment option.**
